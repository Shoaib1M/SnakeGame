# 🐍 Snake Game Project (OOP & Python Fundamentals)

This repository contains my implementation of a **classic Snake game**, developed as part of a comprehensive Python course. It demonstrates key programming concepts including **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **inheritance**, **keyboard event handling**, and **collision detection**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was built step-by-step, following structured lessons aimed at deepening understanding of Python and software design principles. Key components include:

- 🖥️ Screen setup using the `turtle` module
- 🐍 Object-oriented snake body and movement
- 🧠 Class inheritance and method overriding
- 🟩 Food collision and score tracking
- 💥 Wall and tail collision detection
- 🎯 Keyboard controls for real-time gameplay

## 🧱 Features Implemented

- Modular design with custom classes:
  - `Snake`
  - `Food`
  - `Scoreboard`
- Smooth animation using the turtle graphics library
- Real-time user input via keypress
- Clean and readable code with comments
- Python list and tuple slicing for movement logic

## 🧪 Learning Milestones

Each of these milestones was achieved as part of the course:

- ✅ Creating the game screen
- ✅ Animating snake movement
- ✅ Applying class inheritance
- ✅ Handling collisions with food, walls, and tail
- ✅ Keeping and updating the score
- ✅ Slicing lists and tuples in Python

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Turtle graphics library

## 🧠 Course Concepts Practiced

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Class Inheritance and Composition
- Event-driven programming
- List and tuple slicing
- Logical control structures
